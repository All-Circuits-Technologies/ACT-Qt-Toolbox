# End of opened source history

Dear reader. You reached the was-not-yet-open-sourced era.
Deeper project history is not publicly available.

If you are an AC Technologies member, you can continue your reading through
commit d578d07 (tagged "migrated-to-foss")
of archived private repository.
You can also locally bind both eras for a flawless browsing of git history
by fetching archive and its git graft remplacement:

- git remote add archive xxxx  # with xxxx the repository archive private URL
- git fetch archive            # fetch archive branches and tags (hence commits)
- git fetch archive 'refs/replace/*:refs/replace/*' # fetch private replacement
